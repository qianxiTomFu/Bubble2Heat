Bubble2Heat Inference Codes & Models

This Github Folder contains the following items:
1. PECGANMOD: general training and testing of models for optical to thermal inference
2. allCorr/allVar: data from inference results for varying combinations of input conditions.
3. G/D: Trained generators (G) and discriminators (D) used in the paper. The naming of the files reflects the input condition:
   -- pn: number of previous frames included in the input
   -- i0: whether or not reference temperature is included
   -- A: whether or not augmentation is applied
